The Vehichle_length variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset.

The slope of the linear model is not considered to be zero. This is due to the factthe p-value of the linear model was much smaller than the significance level. Proving that the null hypothesis is false.

The  value is 0.7149, this meaning that there is a 71.5% chance that future data points will fit this kind of model. Therefore the linear model does predict mpg of MechaCar

The Mean and Median and all most the same, the varience and the SD are different. In the first two Lots the varience is small but in the 3rd Lot it is much higher and it does exceed 100 pounds per square inch.

For Lot 1 and 2 the p-values are almost the same. we can not reject the null hypothesis. In lot 3 we can reject the null hypothesis, this is because looking at the p-values there is a slight difference in the SD and other aspects on the Lot

Highway Miles on differnt cars and the speed they are driven at can be used to compare as they can be mesured in different metrics.

There is not much diference in Null Hypothesis.

Statistically measurements can be a positive towords finding better performance.

Using new measurments and data to compare Highway miles and the different speend they are driven in can possiably determine the statistical difference between the measurments.
