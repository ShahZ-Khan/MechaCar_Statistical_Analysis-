The Vehichle_length variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset.

The slope of the linear model is not considered to be zero. This is due to the factthe p-value of the linear model was much smaller than the significance level. Proving that the null hypothesis is false.

The  value is 0.7149, this meaning that there is a 71.5% chance that future data points will fit this kind of model. Therefore the linear model does predict mpg of MechaCar

The Mean and Median and all most the same, the varience and the SD are different. In the first two Lots the varience is small but in the 3rd Lot it is much higher and it does exceed 100 pounds per square inch.
